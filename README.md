# leaflet-challenge: Earthquake Visualization Project 

This project uses **Leaflet** and **GeoJSON** to visualize earthquake data from the USGS. It plots earthquake events on a map based on their **magnitude**, **location**, and **depth**. Earthquakes are displayed as circle markers with sizes reflecting their magnitudes and colors indicating their depths.

## Project Features
- Display a map with **earthquake data** fetched from the USGS.
- Use **Leaflet** to plot earthquake markers.
- Earthquake markers vary in size based on their magnitude.
- Markers change color based on earthquake depth (shallow to deep).
- **Popups** are added to display additional earthquake details when markers are clicked.
- A **legend** is displayed to explain the color coding based on depth.
